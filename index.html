        <h3>Why are we here?</h3>
        <p>This is my first webpage written completely by hand. I've gotten this far so things must be going ok. Bravo for me. I plan on learning various coding languages so I decided to start a reference page to keep track of things and maybe document my journey a little as well.</p>
        <p>I am brushing up on some HTML, CSS, and learning Javascript at the moment but hope to learn this plus delve into Ruby on Rails so I can be a Full Stack Developer.  Hopefully this site will help me gather my thoughts and maybe help others as well.  Helping others is always good Karma. <em> #namaste</em></p>
      <b><u><p class="list">A few things about the mind behind the mayhem:</p></u></b>
    <ul>
    </p>
      <li>My first computer was a Commodore 64 and I learned BASIC because it was all we had.  I mainly made inappropriate word based games, but it was the coolest thing ever.</li>
      <li>I'm considered a Xennial.  Yeah, it's a thing now, look it up. I fall right on the cusp of the generational shift.  Exciting, I know. I was the first to use the new wave of technology.  I'm a geek at heart.</li>
      <li>My first phone was a Moto Razr and it was cutting edge technology at the time.  My best flip phone.  We were the cool kids and life was grand.</li>
